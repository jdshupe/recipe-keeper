ingredients:
  - 1 tsp sea salt flakes
  - 1 tsp onion powder
  - 1 tsp garlic powder
  - 1 tsp sweet paprika
  - 1 tsp dried thyme
  - ½ tsp freshly cracked black pepper
  - ¼ cup (60 ml) extra-virgin olive oil
  - '5 boneless chicken thighs (skin on or off, skin-on pictured) (see note 1)'
  - ¼ cup (60 ml) water
  - '1 onion, finely diced'
  - 1 tsp freshly minced garlic
  - 1 cup (200 g) jasmine rice
  - 1½ cups (375 ml) chicken stock (see note 2 about gluten-free)
  - 'Fresh thyme sprigs, to garnish (optional)'
  - Mixed leaf salad
instructions:
  - >-
    Combine the sea salt flakes, onion powder, garlic powder, paprika, thyme,
    pepper and olive oil in a shallow bowl. Add the chicken and use tongs or
    your hands to ensure it is evenly coated in the marinade.
  - >-
    Heat a large, deep, heavy-based pan over medium–high heat. Cook the chicken
    for 6–8 minutes, turning once halfway through, until golden. Remove the
    chicken from the pan and set aside on a plate. Spoon out any excess fat from
    the pan (especially if you used skin-on chicken), if desired – although this
    is not essential, as the fat = extra flavour!
  - >-
    Add the water to deglaze the pan and use a spoon to scrape up any bits stuck
    to the bottom of the pan.
  - >-
    To the same pan, add the onion and garlic. Cook, stirring, for 1–2 minutes
    until fragrant.
  - >-
    Add the rice and stock to the pan, stir and bring to a simmer. Once
    simmering, reduce the heat to low and return the chicken to the pan
    (skin-side up if using skin-on chicken thighs).
  - Cover and cook for 15 minutes.
  - >-
    Once the chicken and rice are cooked, remove the pan from the heat and allow
    it to stand for 10 minutes, covered.
  - 'Serve sprinkled with fresh thyme, if using, and a side of mixed leaf salad.'
