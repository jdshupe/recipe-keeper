  Hummus: not just for pita chips anymore! This versatile dip is the perfect
  topper for these Mediterranean power bowls. Here, it’s mixed with smoky
  paprika for a delicious flavor boost. In case you were wondering, underneath
  the hummus lies a whole world of deliciousness. At the base, there’s fluffy,
  Turkish-spiced couscous mixed with lemon zest. On top, you’ve also got
  cucumber-dill salad, roasted bell pepper and tomato, creamy lemon sauce, and
  crumbly feta cheese. Together, it’s a multi-layered melange that’ll knock your
  chickpea-loving socks off.

instructions:
  - |-
    Preheat oven to 425 degrees. Wash
    and dry all produce. Core, deseed, and
    thinly slice bell pepper. Toss on one side
    of a baking sheet with a drizzle of olive oil,
    half the Turkish Spice, salt, and pepper.
    Toss tomatoes on empty side with a
    drizzle of olive oil, salt, and pepper. Roast
    on top rack until bell pepper is browned
    and softened and tomatoes begin to
    burst, 15-17 minutes. (For 4 servings, use
    2 baking sheets; roast tomatoes on middle
    rack and bell pepper on top rack.)
  - |-
    Meanwhile, trim and halve cucumber
    lengthwise; thinly slice crosswise into half-moons.
    Pick and roughly chop fronds from
    dill. Zest and quarter lemon.
  - |-
    In a small bowl, combine cucumber, half
    the dill, a squeeze of lemon juice, a drizzle
    of olive oil, salt, and pepper. In a separate
    small bowl, combine sour cream, a
    squeeze of lemon juice to taste, salt, and
    pepper. Add water 1 tsp at a time until
    mixture reaches a drizzling consistency.
  - |-
    In a small pot, combine ¾ cup
    water (1½ cups for 4 servings), stock
    concentrate, remaining Turkish Spice,
    1 TBSP butter (2 TBSP for 4), and a
    pinch of salt. Bring to a boil, then stir in
    couscous. Cover and remove from heat.
    Let stand until water has absorbed and
    couscous is tender, at least 5 minutes or
    until ready to serve.
  - |-
    In a third small bowl, combine
    hummus and paprika to taste (start
    with a pinch, then taste and add more
    from there if desired).
  - |-
    Fluff couscous with a fork; stir in lemon
    zest, salt, and pepper; divide between
    bowls. Top with bell pepper, tomatoes,
    cucumber salad, feta, and hummus.
    Drizzle with lemon cream and sprinkle
    with remaining dill. Serve with any
    remaining lemon wedges on the side.
